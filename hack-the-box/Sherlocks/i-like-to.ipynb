    "We have unfortunately been hiding under a rock and did not see the many news articles referencing the recent MOVEit CVE being exploited in the wild. We believe our Windows server may be vulnerable and has recently fallen victim to this compromise. We need to understand this exploit in a bit more detail and confirm the actions of the attacker & retrieve some details so we can implement them into our SOC environment. We have provided you with a triage of all the necessary artifacts from our compromised Windows server. PS: One of the artifacts is a memory dump, but we forgot to include the vmss file. You might have to go back to basics here...\n"
