Accessing the site gave Certificate error request.
Granting a permission did nothing as the page eventually reloaded itself.
Checking the certificate gave the "Certificate Subject Alt Name"
	"DNS Name: 138.247.13.115.xip.io"
Trying the dns name instead also gave nothing, but a unable to connect error
Putting it in HTTPS, as it has a certificate grants us the flag
	"MCA{shuHeimoowaiF5a}"
