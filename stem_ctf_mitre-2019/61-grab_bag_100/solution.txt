The original image has blown out background, either too black or too white.
Guessing this meant some data whas hidden there as the image was viewable, as is.

Found a threshold function in convert and ran it for white, and the first part
appeared.  Figured out how to run the black threshold at the website below, and
tried that as well.

bash commands for convert
	convert Scaredy_Cat.png -white-threshold 0% white.png
	convert Scaredy_Cat.png -black-threshold 100% black.png
