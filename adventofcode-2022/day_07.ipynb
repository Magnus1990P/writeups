    "The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.\n",

    "\n",
    "cd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:\n",
    "cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory.\n",
    "cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.\n",
